# What makes a good book?
This repository contains the files and information for my Udacity Data Scientist Nanodegree submission - Write A Data Science Blog Post. This will be an exploratory analysis on 'What makes a book good' using Google books data

## Installations Needed
Beyond the installation of the Anaconda distribution of python, there should be no other necessary libraries needed to run the code. All libraries required will be installed in the first section of the code. There should be no issues running the code when using Python Version 3. 
You will need to download the copy of the data set (here) to your local machine to be able to run it. To write the code, I used a jupyter noteboook

## Project Motivation
For this project, I was interested in the Google Books data set to try and understand factors related to the rating or popularity of the book. The questions I was interested in were: 
1. What are the highest rated books?
2. Who are the highest rated authors?
3. Does length of the book impact the rating?
4. Does the price of the book impact the rating?
5. What genres are most common?
Many other questions could also be answered from this data set but this is what I started with for the exploratory analysis. The majority of the code in this data set should hopefully lend itself well to other data sets with more rows of books.
